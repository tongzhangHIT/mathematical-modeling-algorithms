Development Notes for psopt toolbox

ver 20091119
* Generalized the algorithm so that it can be called from independent functions.
* Should be able to work with problems with any number of dimensions.
* Convergence criterion should be some tolerance level.
* Syntax matches that of GA Toolbox.
* Plotting functions are separate from main function, using GA Toolbox as a model for organization.

ver 20091130
* Implemented bound checking. Start with initial population distribution (right after options parsing) then run a checking function for the actual swarming process.

ver 20091202
* Bug fix: calling pso using a problem structure should now work properly.
* Closing the plot window in the middle of the simulation will now end the optimization run, returning the current best position and the appropriate exitflag value.
* Ability to call options.OutputFcn -- not yet tested.
* Known minimum, if provided (for plotting only, not aiding algorithm in any way), will now show a flag marking its location on the 3d surface plot.

ver 20091205
* Major bug fix: particles should now comply with linear constraints.
* Bug fix: Known-minimum flag on the demo surface plot no longer defaults to (1,1) if no known minimum is provided.
* Bug fix: regexpr now written properly to check if the test function chosen during psodemo is actually an m-file.
* More test functions included; some have been vectorized for faster demos.
* Added a plotting function which shows the score histogram for the current generation. NOTE: psoplotscores has been reassigned to plot histograms. psoplotrange is now the function which plots the best and mean scores over all iterations.
* Added template for writing custom test functions. NOTE: the algorithm can and should be run without the demonstration features for real problems, by calling pso with the appropriate input arguments. This significantly reduces computational overhead.
* Add option to call hybrid function after swarming is complete.

ver 20091205b
* Fixed bug involving nonlcon being undefined.
* Minor visual improvements.
* Moved surface overlaying code (for demonstration) from main function over to psoplotswarmsurf.

ver 20091210:
* Bug fix: output functions should work now.
* Bug fix: checkbounds should now work even if LB and UB are empty.
* Renamed plotting functions: PSOPLOTBESTF now plots the best and mean scores. PSOPLOTSCOREDIVERSITY now plots the score histogram.
* Implemented 'absorb' style of constraint boundary for problems with linear constraints. Should improve performance for problems with linear equality constraints.
* Social and cognitive attraction parameters can now be adjusted through the options structure.

Next Version:
* Nonlinear inequality constraints can now be used, with 'soft' boundaries only. Nonlinear equality constraints will be ignored for now, due to poor performance of 'soft' boundary checking.
* Demo now has a 'fast' setting requiring less intensive 3d graphics.
* The code which updates the swarm attraction parameters for each iteration has been separated from the main function.

To do before next release:
* Ability to define maximum particle velocities vmax.
* Clerc's method: constriction factor chi to prevent explosive divergence of swarm.

Future:
* New convergence criterion: isothermal equilibrium (Mikki 2008, Chapter 3).
* Ability to define neighborhoods of particles to determine non-local best positions (social parameter).
  - Social stereotyping using clustering algorithm (Kennedy 2000)
  - Von Neumann topology (Kennedy 2002)
* Swarm coherence and collision-avoidance parameters?
* Detect and eliminate dependent (i.e. redundant) linear constraints.
* Ability to use non-linear equality constraints.
* Implement multiobjective optimization option; find Pareto front.
